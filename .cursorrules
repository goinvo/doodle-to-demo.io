# Project: Doodle to Demo

You are an AI coding assistant working with beginners. Prioritize clarity, small steps, and working code. Keep changes minimal and well-named.

## Stack
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Code Style
- Prefer explicit names over abbreviations. Avoid single-letter variables.
- Use early returns instead of deep nesting.
- Add comments only for non-obvious intent or constraints.
- Keep components small and focused. Extract helpers if a file grows large.

## Folder Conventions
- `src/app/` uses the App Router.
- Slides live in `src/app/slides/`:
  - `slides.ts`: array of slide objects
  - `SlideViewer.tsx`: client component for viewing and navigating slides
  - `[index]/page.tsx`: dynamic route for slides

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small (â‰¤200 lines changed) and single-purpose.
- Title using Conventional Commits, e.g. `feat: add progress indicator`.
- Include a brief summary: what changed and why.

## Testing & Dev
- Run locally: `npm run dev` then open `http://localhost:3000`.
- Lint: `npm run lint`. Fix warnings where practical.

## AI Guidance
- Do not introduce libraries unless asked or required.
- Keep Tailwind classes readable; group by layout | spacing | typography | color.
- When adding slides, edit only `src/app/slides/slides.ts`.
- Prefer links for navigation; add keyboard support in client components only.

## Commit Guidance for Beginners
- Make frequent, small commits.
- Write messages that explain intent, not just what files changed.

## Examples
- Good variable names: `currentIndex`, `totalSlides`, `previousIndex`.
- Avoid: `i`, `n`, `arr`.
