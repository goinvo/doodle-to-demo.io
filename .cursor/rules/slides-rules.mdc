Title: Slide creation + design rules for Doodle to Demo

Audience: Designers using Cursor + ChatGPT to add or update slides.
Goal: Keep all new slides visually consistent, accessible, and easy to implement.

Project facts (read-first)
- Framework: Next.js App Router (TypeScript)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Fonts: Switzer (default), IBM Plex Mono for bylines or code-like text
- Key files:
  - `src/app/slides/SlideViewer.tsx` – slide layouts and logic
  - `src/app/components/ResponsiveVideo.tsx` – video/placeholder blocks
  - `src/app/components/SlideNavArrows.tsx` – left/right chevrons
  - `src/app/components/BackgroundVideo.tsx` – global background video

Design system essentials
- Grid: 12 columns. Primary content: left 8 cols, right 4 cols on desktop; stacks on mobile.
- Safe areas: keep text at least 24px from viewport edges on mobile, 32–48px on tablet/desktop.
  - Use existing page paddings: `px-4 sm:px-6`. Prefer left-aligned content blocks for readability.
- Colors: White text over video with a subtle overlay when needed (`bg-black/30`).
- Type scale:
  - Hero big line: `text-[clamp(3rem,7vw+1rem,7rem)]` (bold)
  - Secondary big line: `text-[clamp(2.5rem,6vw+1rem,6rem)]` (normal/italic as needed)
  - Tagline: `text-[clamp(1rem,1.2vw+0.6rem,1.5rem)]` (80–90% opacity)
- Fonts:
  - Default: Switzer
  - Byline or monospaced accents: IBM Plex Mono → use `font-mono`
- Buttons:
  - Primary CTA: white pill with sharper radius: `rounded-xl bg-white text-black`
  - Add motion: subtle pulse loop (already implemented on slide 1)
- Videos:
  - Corner radius ~16px (`rounded-2xl`), 16:9 `aspect-video`, `object-cover`

When adding a new slide
1) Start with a reference image or annotated mock.
2) Decide the layout type:
   - Hero with left text block over full-bleed video (Slides 2–3 style)
   - Two stacked videos on the right with left text block (Slide 1 style)
3) Maintain spacing: keep lines away from edges using the safe areas above. Use the same paddings already in `SlideViewer.tsx`.
4) Match typography: reuse sizes and weights shown in existing slides; emphasize with italic/bold where needed.
5) Accessibility: ensure text has sufficient contrast; add/keep the dark overlay if background is busy.

Implementation guidance (what to ask ChatGPT to do)
- Add a new conditional branch in `SlideViewer.tsx` for the next index (e.g., `currentIndex === 3`).
- Copy the closest existing slide section and adjust:
  - Text content, line breaks, and emphasis (`<em>` or font weight)
  - Positioning container (e.g., `absolute left-4 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`)
  - Overlay if needed: `absolute inset-0 bg-black/30`
  - Keep safe offsets: `left-4 sm:left-6` and `bottom-6 right-6` for attribution
- Keep nav arrows by placing the shared `<SlideNavArrows ... />` over the slide root.
- For right-column videos on desktop: put them in the 4-col aside using `ResponsiveVideo`. On mobile, ensure the videos appear first (`order-1`) so at least one video is above the fold.

Positioning rules for hero text (Slides 2–3 style)
- Container: absolutely position a wrapper and vertically center it: `absolute left-4 sm:left-6 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`
- Title block width: `max-w-xl`–`max-w-2xl` (avoid full width); keep rag width consistent across slides
- Stacking: use multiple `<span className="block">` lines for deliberate breaks; emphasize key words with `<em>`

Motion rules
- Use `framer-motion` for tasteful entrances and a gentle CTA pulse.
- Recommended timings (match existing slides):
  - Title lines: stagger children by `0.12`, each fades up (`y: 10 -> 0`, `opacity: 0 -> 1`).
  - Tagline: delay `0.4s`, duration `0.5s`.
  - CTA (button): delay `0.9s`, duration `0.45s`.
  - Video thumbs: staggered fade/slide in `y: 12 -> 0`, stagger `0.15`.
- CTA pulse loop (keep subtle):
  - Animate on the button element, not its wrapper.
  - `scale: [1, 1.04, 1]`, `boxShadow` cycles, `duration: 1.6s`, `repeat: Infinity`, `repeatDelay: 2.2s`.

Arrows and interactions
- Always render `<SlideNavArrows previousHref nextHref className="absolute inset-0 z-20" />` above slide content.
- Do NOT disable pointer events on the wrapper; arrows must be clickable.
- Sizes: hero slides use `iconSize={44}`; standard slides use `36`.

How to change the background video per slide (simple approach)
Option A – Map by route in `BackgroundVideo.tsx`:
1. Edit `src/app/components/BackgroundVideo.tsx` to read the pathname and choose a video.
2. Use this snippet:
   ```ts
   import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

   const videoByRoute: Record<string, string> = {
     "/slides/0": "/video/GenAI%20Robot.mp4",
     "/slides/1": "/video/your-video-1.mp4",
     "/slides/2": "/video/your-video-2.mp4",
   };

   const pathname = usePathname();
   const src = videoByRoute[pathname ?? ""] ?? "/video/GenAI%20Robot.mp4";
   ```
3. Set the `<video src={src} ... />` to use this `src`.

Option B – Inline per slide (fastest for experiments)
- Remove the global background video from `layout.tsx` for that slide only and render a local `<video>` element inside the slide branch, positioned `fixed inset-0 -z-10` with an overlay. Use the same Tailwind classes as `BackgroundVideo`.

CTA implementation details
- Use Next `Link` with `legacyBehavior passHref` and place the motion on the anchor:
  ```tsx
  <Link href="/slides/1" legacyBehavior passHref>
    <motion.a
      className="inline-flex h-12 items-center justify-center rounded-xl bg-white px-6 text-sm font-semibold text-black"
      animate={{ scale: [1, 1.04, 1], boxShadow: [
        "0 8px 30px rgba(255,255,255,0.12)",
        "0 8px 40px rgba(255,255,255,0.20)",
        "0 8px 30px rgba(255,255,255,0.12)",
      ]}}
      transition={{ duration: 1.6, ease: "easeInOut", repeat: Infinity, repeatDelay: 2.2 }}
    >
      Let’s start
    </motion.a>
  </Link>
  ```

Prompts designers can paste into Cursor
- “Add a new slide for index 3 based on the Slide 2 hero layout. Use the copy: ‘Old methods & workflows feel slow and redundant’, italicize ‘slow’, bold italic ‘redundant’. Keep safe areas like Slide 2, and add the bottom-right attribution. Reuse `SlideNavArrows`. No new dependencies.”
- “Change the background video for `/slides/2` to `/video/YourFile.mp4` by mapping route -> video in `BackgroundVideo.tsx`. Keep autoplay, muted, loop, and object-cover.”
- “Add two stacked videos to the right column on slide 4 using `ResponsiveVideo`. On mobile, show the videos first. Use `rounded-2xl`, `aspect-video`, and `space-y-4`.”

Consistency checklist (run before finishing)
- Safe areas respected on mobile and desktop
- Type sizes follow existing clamps; emphasized words match weight/italic rules
- Overlay present if text readability needs it
- CTA timing: appears after tagline; pulse is subtle and not distracting
- Nav arrows visible and not overlapping critical content
- Lint/build passes

Do/Don’t
- Suggest new packages only when necessary; prefer built-ins. If proposing, ensure they’re widely used and low-risk.
- Do keep PRs small and single-purpose.
- Don’t position text flush to the viewport edges; always use the safe offsets.
